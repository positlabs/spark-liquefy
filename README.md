# Meta Spark Liquefy

This effect is like the liquefy filter in Photoshop. It lets the user smudge the camera texture by swiping their finger on the screen.

There are slider controls in the patch editor so you can easily adjust the parameters to fit your project.

Brush controls include size, hardness, and opacity. It makes smooth strokes even with fast movements, using an [SDF line segment](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Wlfyzl) by Inigo Quilez. [Brush Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThGGqbRPysY&ab_channel=JoshBeckwith)

Decay will slowly return the distortion back to normal.

And of course the distortion slider controls the strength of the distortion.
