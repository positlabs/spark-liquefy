# Meta Spark UV Distortion Painter

This effect is a simple UV distortion painter, created from an SDF circle and some texture transforms. It's purely patch-based so it should be easy to understand by stepping through the node graph previews.

It comes with some slider controls so you can play around with the effect in the simulator.
